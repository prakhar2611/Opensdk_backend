    "response": "I apologize for the continued difficulties. It appears there's a quota issue with the API service that powers these tools. \n\nUnfortunately, I'm unable to retrieve the revenue information for seller 6771 from the monthly_seller_atg_brand table at this time due to these technical limitations. \n\nWhen the service is available again, we would run a query like:\n```sql\nSELECT seller_id, SUM(revenue) as total_revenue \nFROM monthly_seller_atg_brand \nWHERE seller_id = 6771 \nGROUP BY seller_id\n```\n\nWould you like me to try a different approach or would you prefer to try again later when the service is restored?"
