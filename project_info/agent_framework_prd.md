# Product Requirements Document: AI Agent-Based Application Framework

## 1. Overview

This document describes a framework for building applications powered by a multi-agent architecture that enables AI systems to interact with databases, analyze data, and provide user-friendly outputs. The framework is designed to be modular, extensible, and focused on delivering high-quality interactions through specialized AI agents working together.

## 2. Core Architecture

### 2.1. Agent Framework

The system is built on an agent architecture with the following components:

- **Agent Class**: Core class representing an AI agent with:
  - Name and instructions
  - Tool registration capability
  - Handoff mechanisms to other agents
  - Lifecycle hooks for tracing and monitoring

- **Runner**: Executes agents and manages their workflows
  - Handles execution context
  - Manages tracing and monitoring
  - Processes agent outputs

- **Trace System**: Records agent activities for debugging and monitoring
  - Captures agent calls, tool usage, and handoffs
  - Provides visibility into the execution flow

### 2.2. Multi-Agent Design Pattern

The framework implements three key patterns:

1. **Orchestrator Pattern**
   - Central orchestrator agent delegates tasks to specialized agents
   - Manages workflow between agents
   - Makes decisions about which agent handles which request

2. **Agents-as-Tools Pattern**
   - Agents can be registered as tools for other agents
   - Enables nested agent calls and specialization
   - Supports passing enhanced context between agents

3. **Synthesizer Pattern**
   - Final agent that combines outputs from multiple agents
   - Creates coherent responses from distributed processing
   - Ensures consistent user experience

## 3. Specialized Agents

### 3.1. Orchestrator Agent
- Coordinates the overall workflow
- Routes user requests to appropriate specialized agents
- Maintains context across agent interactions

### 3.2. Database Agent (ClickHouse)
- Connects to database systems
- Executes queries and retrieves data
- Provides schema information and database metadata

### 3.3. Analyst Agent
- Performs data analysis on query results
- Identifies patterns, outliers, and correlations
- Generates statistical insights

### 3.4. Visualization Agent
- Creates data visualizations
- Converts data to visual formats (charts, graphs)
- Customizes visualizations based on data characteristics

### 3.5. User Input Agent
- Processes and refines user inputs
- Extracts intent and parameters
- Formats requests for other agents

### 3.6. Synthesizer Agent
- Combines outputs from multiple agents
- Creates coherent, unified responses
- Ensures consistency in communication

## 4. Tool System

### 4.1. Function Tools
- Python functions registered as tools for agents
- Support for type annotations and validation
- Automatic documentation generation

### 4.2. Agent Tools
- Agents exposed as tools to other agents
- Nested calling capabilities
- Context passing between agents

## 5. Implementation Requirements

### 5.1. Setup and Configuration

1. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   pip install agents langchain autogen openai clickhouse-connect python-dotenv
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Create a `.env` file with:
     - OpenAI API keys
     - Database connection parameters
     - Configuration settings

3. **SSL Bypass Configuration**
   - Implement SSL verification bypass for development
   - Configure HTTPS clients appropriately

### 5.2. Agent Creation

1. **Define Agent Instructions**
   - Create clear, role-based instructions for each agent
   - Specify responsibilities and interaction patterns

2. **Register Tools and Functions**
   - Create function tools with `@function_tool` decorator
   - Register agents as tools using `agent.as_tool()`

3. **Implement Lifecycle Hooks**
   - Create custom hooks extending `AgentHooks`
   - Implement monitoring and logging

### 5.3. Application Flow

1. **Main Application Structure**
   ```python
   async def main():
       # Set up environment
       load_dotenv()
       http_client = setup_ssl_bypass()
       
       # Create agents
       orchestrator_agent = create_orchestrator_agent()
       synthesizer_agent = create_synthesizer_agent()
       
       # Get user input
       user_query = input("What would you like to do?")
       
       # Process with orchestrator
       with trace("Application Session"):
           orchestrator_result = await Runner.run(
               orchestrator_agent, 
               user_query,
               run_config=RunConfig(tracing_disabled=False)
           )
           
           # Synthesize final response
           synthesizer_result = await Runner.run(
               synthesizer_agent, 
               orchestrator_result.to_input_list()
           )
           
       # Display final result
       print(synthesizer_result.final_output)
   ```

2. **Agent Handoff Flow**
   - Orchestrator receives user query
   - Determines appropriate specialized agent
   - Hands off request with enhanced context
   - Collects results and passes to synthesizer

## 6. Extension Points

### 6.1. New Agent Types
- Create new specialized agents for specific domains
- Follow the agent creation pattern with instructions and tools

### 6.2. Additional Tool Integration
- Register external APIs as function tools
- Connect to additional data sources and services

### 6.3. Enhanced Monitoring
- Extend agent hooks for additional logging and metrics
- Implement persistence for traces and debugging

## 7. Implementation Choices

### 7.1. LangChain vs. AutoGen vs. Custom Agents Framework

#### Custom Agents Framework
- Provides fine-grained control over agent behavior
- Supports specialized agent patterns
- Enables detailed tracing and monitoring

#### LangChain Alternative
- Use LangChain's agent framework for similar patterns
- Leverage existing tools and integrations
- Example implementation:
  ```python
  from langchain.agents import Tool, AgentExecutor, LLMSingleActionAgent
  from langchain.llms import OpenAI
  
  llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
  tools = [
      Tool(name="ClickHouse", func=clickhouse_agent_func),
      Tool(name="Analyst", func=analyst_agent_func),
      Tool(name="Visualizer", func=visualization_agent_func)
  ]
  
  agent = LLMSingleActionAgent(llm=llm, tools=tools)
  agent_executor = AgentExecutor.from_agent_and_tools(agent=agent, tools=tools)
  ```

#### AutoGen Alternative
- Use AutoGen for multi-agent conversations
- Create specialized assistant agents
- Example implementation:
  ```python
  from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent
  
  clickhouse_assistant = AssistantAgent("clickhouse_assistant", 
                                        system_message="ClickHouse expert...")
  analyst_assistant = AssistantAgent("analyst_assistant",
                                    system_message="Data analysis expert...")
  
  user_proxy = UserProxyAgent("user_proxy")
  groupchat = autogen.GroupChat(agents=[user_proxy, clickhouse_assistant, analyst_assistant])
  manager = autogen.GroupChatManager(groupchat=groupchat)
  ```

## 8. Conclusion

This framework provides a flexible and powerful approach to building AI applications using a multi-agent architecture. By leveraging specialized agents, orchestration patterns, and robust tool systems, developers can create applications that effectively process user requests, interact with data sources, and deliver high-quality responses.
